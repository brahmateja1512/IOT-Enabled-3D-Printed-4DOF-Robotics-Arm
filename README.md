# IOT-Enabled-3D-Printed-4DOF-Robotics-Arm
This project features a 4-DOF robotic arm built from 3D-printed parts and MG996R servos. Powered by an ESP32, it utilizes IoT protocols for remote control via a web app. With base, shoulder, elbow, and gripper joints, it enables global teleoperation. This low-cost system is ideal for education and handling hazardous materials remotely
